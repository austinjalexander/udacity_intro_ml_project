# udacity_intro_ml_project



The report did specify the general analysis strategy although it wasn't totally clear to me what the final feature and algorithm were. The report is going to need more detail about how the analysis was done in order to pass. I'll talk about the specific issues in other rubric boxes. But the written report needs to stand on its own apart from the code.


The project should include a python (.py) file so that the reviewer knows which file belongs to the final analysis strategy. We also need to be able to easily run the python file to make the pkl files and test the results.
